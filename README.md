# Note
Everything is mostly explained in game but as a formality, here's everything you need to know about the controls and mechanics.

## Basic Controls
Move with WASD, Jump with the spacebar, Dash with the shift button, Tab switches you between clones and players. You can also jump higher if you hold the spacebar in instead of just tapping it.

## Mechanics
Blue pads are pressure plates which can be used to open door and remove obstacles. Green pads will clone you and allow you to control multiple players with Tab. Yellow pads teleport you to corresponding dark yellow pads. Flags are checkpoints. Signs can give helpful hints if your stuck. Bullets will instantly reset you to your last checkpoint
or send you back to the start.
